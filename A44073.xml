            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my very much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friend <hi>JOHN NORTON</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſtock</hi> in the County of <hi>Northampton</hi> Eſq</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> double account may poſſibly be expected from me, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the following Treatiſe and of the preſent Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A threefold exception may perhaps be made to that, that tis a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, that tis an Elenchtical Catechiſm or a Catechetical confutation of Errors, and that 'tis ſuch a Scripture Catechiſme, or the Anſwers to the Queſtions moſtly the very letter of the Scripture. If any blame
<pb facs="tcp:40728:3"/> me, ſaying 'tis below a Preacher to publiſh a Catechiſme now in theſe dayes wherein even ſome of the people are got up above the higheſt Ordinances. My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that as I have not been aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to practiſe the deſpiſed duty of Catechizing at home in my own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſo I ſhall not bluſh to countenance and avouch it to the world. I know and conſider that our Lord and Maſter, the great Shepheard and Biſhop of ſoules, gave in charge to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to feed his Lambes as well as his ſheep, and that 'tis the part of a faithfull Steward or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in God's family not as the Papiſts ſay to diſpenſe with, but to diſpenſe or adminiſter the Ordinances of God, and to provide for every one of the family his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in due ſeaſon, to ſee that the Babes have Milk as well as Strong men Meat. I doe not here ſet before Chriſt's little ones whole ſheep or whole joints, as is done in large Tracts or Volumes of ſuch ſubjects, but theſe diſhes cut up and carv'd out, and it may be minc'd too, that very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Babes in knowledge may feed themſelves.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40728:3"/>
            <p>Beſides, I dare ſay that there is even in theſe times but need of Catechizing: for want of laying this Foundation how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fooliſh Builders have fondly built Caſtles in the aire to no purpoſe: for want of this Ballaſt how many have been toſſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine: And now if we would Regulate mens fooliſh high-towring fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, one way ſure, is to lay, not to raze Foundations. If we would make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Separation 'twixt theſe fond lovers and their new-fangled Errours, one way is, to Reconcile and bring them home againe to, and in love with their old firſt and beſt Principles.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond exception, that 'tis a <hi>Catecheticall</hi> confutation of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; I ſay, ſuch an Enemy as Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is, may lawfully be driven out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way: and that 'tis but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to uſe the ſame method to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute error, that others have done to confirme it. I ſhall herein imitate the skillfull Phyſitian, who endeavours to expell the poyſon out of the body
<pb facs="tcp:40728:4"/> the ſame way by which it was firſt taken in.</p>
            <p>And now if any be diſsatisfied that 'tis a Scripture-Catechiſme; I ſay, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath in a ſort compelled us: have they Scripture in their Catechiſmes ſeemingly for them, ſo have we really for us: have they appealed unto Scripture, unto Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhall they goe. They ſay the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are theirs, and we ſay nay; but the Scriptures are ours: what then? is the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture neither ours, nor theirs, but is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided partly for us and partly for them? or have we ten parts in it, and they two? I anſwer, No in no wiſe, ther's no ſuch matter, It is all ours, it is our owne and not Strangers, not our enemies with us. I confeſſe ſuch hath been the Injuſtice and violence of erroneous Perſons, as to take away ſundry Scriptures by force to put them upon the racke and torture them, and lay to their charge things they know not, to make them confeſſe againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the truth, and us. But if this witneſſe may be permitted to ſpeak for it ſelfe, to ſpeak freely and fully, to ſpeak out, to ſpeak all it will ſay, it will teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<pb facs="tcp:40728:4"/> only to the truth, and when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath ſo ſpoken, Errour muſt either ſtop it's eares or ſtop it's mouth. For the Scriptures may then ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi> we can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth: or that may be the language of the written word which was of the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Word of God, I came to beare witneſse of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Now, if it was an honourable atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Abraham</hi> to reſcue his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> and in <hi>David</hi> to reſcue the men of Ziklag out of the hands of them who had carried them captive; I hope ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as this to reſcue ſo many Scriptures out of the hands of them who have carried them captive and ſpoiled them, and ſet them ſome of them in the front of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell againſt the truth and us, ſhall have the countenance, good-will, and good wiſhes of them that love the truth.</p>
            <p>For my part whether the world ſmile or frown, commend or condemne, I reſolve to goe out againſt, ſet upon, and grapple with this great Goliah of Errour, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to goe out againſt him in the name of
<pb facs="tcp:40728:5"/> the Lord of Hoſts, endeavouring to ſling theſe ſmooth ſtones (choſen out of this chriſtall brook the holy Scriptures) ſo, as to ſmite this Philiſtine in the forehead and cauſe him to fall.</p>
            <p>And S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, if I may be a champion for truth, and by the ſword of the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the crowne upon the head of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Arch Rebel and Traytor, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> which would depoſe it from it's throne and Soveraignty, I ſhall (I hope) therein rejoyce and triumph although the world ſhould laugh at and trample upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>I doe not profeſſe my ſelfe the firſt or only diſcoverer of theſe Monſters,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>D.</hi> Owen. <hi>D.</hi> Bailye.</note> nor that dared to fight with theſe beaſts I have two eminent Captaines and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions who have gone before and entred the liſts, one in a like, and the other in the ſame quarrel, to both which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe indebted, and although I doe not pay the one in the ſame coine (his Treatiſe being latine) yet I hope in plaine Engliſh (in part at leaſt) to ſatisfie my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to them both: For (as one well
<pb facs="tcp:40728:5"/> ſaith) the Scriptures are a Mine where there will be ever found ſome oare ſo long as there is any to digge: or like the Widdow's oyle which never ceaſed running ſo long as there was ever an empty veſſell to receive it.</p>
            <p>I dare not ſay I have found out any new truths, yet perhaps have made ſome further hue and cry after new Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. And if 'tis a commendable thing to diſcover a new Iſland or Continent, let me not be cenſured if I point out other Rocks, ſhelves, or Sands, togeither with a paſsage to avoid them; I mean new found Errors, ſo as to prevent my own &amp; others making ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience by them.</p>
            <p>Now if in any place I have given, in anſwer to an objection from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, another text of Scripture only, I would not be thought to endeavour to ſet the Scriptures together by the eares, but to compare them, to bring them together face to face, and by a friendly enterview and conference to reconcile them, though when they are aſunder they ſeem
<pb facs="tcp:40728:6"/> to be at odds and difference, yet when they are brought together and we heare both ſpeak they may eaſily be reconciled: They ſeeme obſcure perhaps ſingle, but ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they give light to each other. So true is that Rule, Scripture is the beſt Interpreter of Scripture.</p>
            <p>And Farther, as the ſeed of the Serpent the Generation of Vipers, Heretickes and ſeducers have learn't of the Divel that old Serpent to urge Scripture againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that is, the letter of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true ſenſe, ſcope and meaning of it. So may the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> learne of Chriſt the ſeed of the Woman to anſwer Scripture with Scripture, and therefore when they plead and object as the Divel did, It is written; we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer or reply as our Saviour did. It is written againe. <hi>Math. 4 6, 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>,</hi> Amongſt other Errours that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt withall both ancient and moderne, at home and abroad, there is one, I hope, you will not cenſure me for ingaging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, becauſe in my own defence, and that
<pb facs="tcp:40728:6"/> is the Error of thoſe who would extirpate Miniſtry root and branch, that ſay of ſuch men and their maintenance, wherefore is this loſſe; when they cry out upon us as Prieſts of Baal, 'tis high time for us to prove our ſelves the Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp; when they ſay of us or to us as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Iſraelites, ye are idle, ye are idle; tis but our duty to buſy our ſelvs with both hands, to build with the one and ſtrive with the other to hold a ſword in one hand, &amp; a trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in the other. <hi>Ne. 4.17, 18.</hi> Can builders, Souldiers, husband-men, labourers in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, workers &amp; Fellow workers together with God be juſtly taxed and cenſured for idle Perſons or men of no calling? And yet ſuch are the Miniſters of the Goſpel: a lazie Monk may indeed have good cauſe to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his profeſsion, becauſe if his Cowle doe not, his calling will not, or is not like to make him ſweat; Yet that Preacher who puts his hand to God's plough and followes it hard therewith to break up the fallow ground of his own and others hard hearts, will make furrowes in his own face.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40728:7"/>
            <p>I know the pretence and practiſe is to undermine the maintenance, but the plot is to blow up the Miniſtry. The glorious lamps of our Tabernacles are not like to burn long if the golden oyle be preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. I know we may ſay that the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> is in all this, and 'tis this wicked <hi>Haman</hi> which hath done it, the Divell or the Pope is the Father of this Monſter: They know that the Miniſters are the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and horſemen of Iſrael, and that if theſe be diſcomfited, the Infantry are in danger to be ſcattered.</p>
            <p>Oh that men were ſo wiſe as to conſider the deſignes of theſe enemies. The Popiſh Emiſsaries would exclude us, that you might affect them; would diet or ſtarve us, that they might fill, if not ſurfet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Devill would allow the falſe Prophet <hi>Balaam</hi> to ride with his two men, and yet would force the true Prophets to goe afoot. Antichriſt would have his own Prieſts many of them Princes, but the Miniſters of Chriſt all of them the meaneſt and loweſt of the people.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40728:7"/>
            <p>But what godly heart ſhould without ſorrow ſee Chriſts witneſſes propheſy in ſackcloth, when the Prieſts of Anti-Chriſt ruſſell and rant it in ſattin.<note n="a" place="margin">In Italy beſides the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtate of the Popes of Rome the Clergy are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have in ſome places a third part of the whole; but in moſt a moyetie. In Spaine the certaine rents of the Arch-Biſhoprick of Toledo are ſaid to be no leſſe than 300000 crownes <hi>per annum,</hi> which is far more than all the Biſhops, Deanes and Prebendaries doe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe in England. <hi>Treleinie</hi> of tythes <hi>pag.</hi> 12.13.

            </p>

I rather chooſe to intreat thee, if thou art as well as knowing ſo alſo Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, Courteous, charitable, either to correct or pardon all the faults of this piece; So far at leaſt as to accept &amp; favour the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> rather than to carp at the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40728:10"/> whether they have proceeded from the Author, the Tranſcriber, or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>If thou art a <hi>Catechumen,</hi> and one deſirous to learne, two things I intreat of thee: the one is, to read it (if it may be with thy conveniency,) <hi>wholly;</hi> ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly thou mayeſt the better underſtand the ſeverall parts of it. The other is, not to be offended becauſe ſometimes thou findeſt in thy way <hi>Yes</hi> or <hi>No</hi> in the Porch or Entrie of the Anſwer, and ſometimes not; Where this Porter ſtandes at the dore, I would not you ſhould take his bare word for anſwer, and ſo paſſe along, and goe your way; but that he may open you the dore to goe in, and view the places themſelves, to ſee whether it be indeed ſo or no, as is pretended; and that you may believe, not becauſe I <hi>told</hi> you, but becauſe you have <hi>heard</hi> the Scriptures themſelves. Where there is no ſuch at the dore of the Anſwer to let you in. I deſire you now once for all, not to ſtay there, but without farther Ceremonie to walke in, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:40728:10"/> to goe round about the places, to tell the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof, and to marke well her bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, I meane the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of thoſe texts of Scripture ſet there for the defence of the Truth.</p>
            <p>VVhoſoever thou art, who ſhalt pleaſe to peruſe this <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> I ſay to thee before hand, I will not, I dare not avouch it (ſo far as 'tis mine) to be free from all errour. I am but a man, &amp; if thou wilt forgive me, I will promiſe when opportunity ſerves to correct, or retract ſuch miſtakes. But this I dare ſay, I doe not erre <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> out of mere oppoſition to any party or perſon; I am a Chriſtian, and if I ſhould ſo erre my ſelfe (whileſt I confute the errours of others) I aſſure thee (if I know my own heart) without repentance and amendment, I ſhould not forgive my ſelfe. And now to prevent miſtakes and miſconſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelfe and others, be pleaſed to take notice, that I will not undertake to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify my ſelfe to have been in this <hi>Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> an exact or compleat Herauld, and to have marſhal'd the ſeverall errours under
<pb facs="tcp:40728:11"/> their proper Commanders and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and to have ranked them all in their right place and due order. And if the Quakers renounce any of the following errours, rang'd under the Head or Chapter which beares their name, let them know I deſire not to doe violence to erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; or to accuſe them falſely, and therefore premiſe this, that the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Chapter may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for a ſufficient evidence to charge them with them, &amp; I here allow them liberty (provided they doe it truely) to diſowne them, or to refuſe to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to any thing therein contained.</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou reapeſt benefit from this <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> if it ſhall pleaſe God by this meanes to ſhew thee his wayes, and teach thee his pathes, to lead thee in his truth, &amp; teach thee in the way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou ſhouldeſt goe, bleſſe God who hath ſhewed us light, &amp; pray with me for thoſe who yet wander in dark and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathes
<pb facs="tcp:40728:11"/> of errour, forſaking God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and our ſolemne Aſſemblies.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the ſaying of a very learned &amp; ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">D. Cudw.</note> 
               <hi>Truth and Love are two the moſt powerfull things in the world; and that the golden beames of Truth, and the ſilken cords of Love twiſted together, will draw men on with a ſweet violence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no.</hi> I deſire for my part I may both in word &amp; deed, conference &amp; converſation, in preaching, printing &amp; practiſing, experiment the truth of this Teſtimony; and in all to be ſo happy my ſelfe, as to make others happy alſo: in all undertakings to follow the practiſe and paterne of the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>truth</hi> it in <hi>love,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40728:14"/> ſo to inlighten men, who ſit in the region of darknes, as not to inflame them; ſo to convince the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of error, that they may not ſay I am become their enemy; when I tell them the truth, that they may ſee that I aime at and endeavour their converſion, and not their confuſion. I know the Apoſtles themſelves had a zeale, but not according to knowledge, when they were ſo earneſt to have called for fire from heaven to conſume the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans:</hi> the <hi>Sons of Thunder</hi> would have been <hi>Sons of Lightning</hi> too, but they had not ſo learned of Chriſt: <hi>ye know not,</hi> ſaith he <hi>of what ſpirit ye are of.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the Spirit of Chriſt came down upon the Apoſtles in the dayes of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> though with a ruſhing migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wind, and ſate upon each of them in the likeneſſe of fiery cloven tongues, yet neither did that wind ſmite the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of any houſe, that it fell; nor thoſe fiery tongues ſinge a haire of their own or others heads. Inſtead of calling for fire from heaven to conſume you, I pray, and endeavour that I may ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:40728:14"/> you a light from heaven ſhining round about you, above the light of the Sun at noon-day: I mean cleare and evident Scriptures to inlighten, convince and convert you.</p>
            <p>If I deſire to be ſometimes a <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> indeed, yet 'tis in order to be a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas:</hi> If I heap coales of fire on your heads, I ſeek to melt you, not to burne you: when I thunder againſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, I deſire my ſpeeches and actions may be like that lightning, which breaks or melts the ſword, and doth not hurt the ſcabbard; I deſire to melt your ſoules, but not doe the leaſt hurt to your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the ſheath of your ſoules.</p>
            <p>That there is a God, and this God is to be worſhipped, is, I hope, written in your hearts, as with a pen of iron, or point of a Diamond, that is, with a laſting or indelible, and as with a Sun-beam, that is, with a legible character.</p>
            <p>And if you ſay, <hi>wherewithal ſhall I come before God, and bow my ſelfe unto the moſt high?</hi> ſhall I make an Image or likenes of
<pb facs="tcp:40728:15"/> him, or ſhall I come to him by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Saints and Angels? I anſwer, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,</hi> and what thou ſhouldeſt believe and doe. Thou needeſt not ſay, <hi>who ſhall aſcend up into heaven,</hi> to bring Chriſt down from above? But <hi>the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart:</hi> and this is the word which in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is made known unto you.</p>
            <p>Since men therefore erre, becauſe they know not the Scriptures, the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Scriptures thus to every man's conſcience may poſſibly prove a good way and meanes to reclaime them from errour. God hath <hi>magnified his word above all his name,</hi> and therefore 'tis but reaſon that men ſhould advance it above all humane Teſtimony; and if you will plead the Teſtimony of men, <hi>ſurely the Teſtimony of God is greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea if you would be but Reaſonable, if you would ſhew your ſelves men, and act as Religious men, and good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, men of the pureſt and higheſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:40728:15"/> I might boldly plead with you thus, and ſhew you what I have to ſay on God's behalfe: I might deſire you to heare God ſpeak in the Scriptures, and ſay, whether it be fit to believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God or man, Judge ye.</p>
            <p>If you plead Scripture, pretending that your Church of Rome was once true; I may juſtly alleadge Scriptures to ſhew <hi>from whence you are fallen,</hi> and to prove that you have greatly erred.</p>
            <p>Is the Scripture of force to prove that ſhe was once a <hi>true Church,</hi> and <hi>a chaſt Spouſe of Chriſt;</hi> and is it not to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in evidence that now ſhe is become a <hi>Mother of Fornications,</hi> and <hi>hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery</hi> with ſtocks and ſtones?</p>
            <p>For our parts, we are willing to ſtand and fall by Scripture, to be <hi>weighed</hi> in the ſame <hi>ballance</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> with you, to have our <hi>Gold</hi> tryed by the ſame <hi>touchſtone</hi> of the word, and to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſame <hi>buſhel</hi> or <hi>Epha,</hi> by which we meaſure you or others.</p>
            <p>If you appeale from a higher to a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er court, from God to Man, from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40728:16"/> to <hi>Fathers;</hi> beſides that 'tis againſt the mind of God, againſt right reaſon, and the Methods of wiſe men; ſo 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> I dare ſay, if they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe againe from the dead, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, we be Judges of no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or <hi>who made us a judge over the Scriptures?</hi> yea being dead, they yet ſpeak in their writings againſt ſuch <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> and <hi>practiſes;</hi> they make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures their Judges, and make not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves judges of the Scripture: yea if the <hi>Fathers</hi> might be heard out, teſtifying fully to the perfection and ſufficiency of the Holy Scriptures, that one ſentence of theirs will prove a condemnation of Popery, of the body and ſoule of it, the Fathers themſelves being Judges.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly it may be ſaid by ſome of you, that the Proteſtant Religion is but of yeſterday, and knows nothing of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> nor the Fathers of it; &amp; that ſuch a novel faith, as it may be prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be, dares not appeare at the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> The truth is, if there were no
<pb facs="tcp:40728:16"/> Scripture, the Proteſtants durſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>Ordeal,</hi> or <hi>tryall</hi> by <hi>Fathers</hi> and Councels: &amp; ſaving alwaies the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Holy Scriptures, and our juſt Liberty of appeale unto them, the Proteſtants <hi>golden</hi> Faith doth not feare the <hi>ſilver</hi> haires of the Antient Fathers. The truth is, we would not be cheated or gulled with mouldy bread, and old ſhooes, &amp; a mere pretence of Religion, that came to us from far, from many ages agoe: when as indeed, &amp; in truth, aske the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> and they will tell you another Story, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Primitive and moſt antient Church. If you will heare the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants judgment, plea, and evidence in this matter, let me produce three or four to ſpeak for the reſt.</p>

            <p>But I muſt not paſſe by the Teſtimony of <hi>Cornelius Muſſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> viz. for my own part (that I may ſpeak my mind freely) in things that belong to the teſtimony of Faith, I had rather believe one ſingle <hi>Pope,</hi> than a thouſand <hi>Auguſtines, Hieromes,</hi> or <hi>Gregories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you will appeale from the holy Scriptures, and from the Authority of
<pb facs="tcp:40728:18"/> the Catholick Church to the Roman, or Church of one denomination, from the Primitive to the Preſent, or from the antient to the moderne, and dare not, or will not be judged by any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but by your ſelves, beſides that you are guilty of high preſumption thus to advance your ſelves into the chaire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, ſo is it a ſtrong preſumption of guilt in you, that you dare not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the tryall of the moſt impartiall and unbyaſſed Judges; and hereby you declare, that the Authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is not ſupream in your account, and why then ſhould you expect it ſhould be authoritative with us; and if you appeale from the Fathers here to the preſent Church, why may we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Scriptures? I ſhall adde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that when you appeale to Churches, or Fathers, or Councels, from Scripture, you doe ſhew your ſelves more ſubtle than the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who to all Chriſt's allegations of Scripture never put in ſuch an anſwer, that there is but one true Church; <hi>we are the true Church,
<pb facs="tcp:40728:19"/> we are the Interpreters of Scripture.</hi> Yea I ſhall go a ſtep farther with you, and tell you, that if you appeale from Scripture teſtimony to your preſent Church, or to ſome viſible and infallible judge of all controverſies, you doe therein out-goe that old Sophiſter the Devill, who when he diſputed with our Saviour, and Scripture was urged againſt him, had not the Jewiſh Churches Authority, the Interpretations of Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, no, never a ſuch reſerve, or caſtle to fly unto.</p>
            <p>There are two great Errors, <hi>mother-errors</hi> of you the children of the Church of Rome, concerning the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: the one is, that you will not goe to it as to your <hi>laſt judge</hi> on earth: and the other, that you endeavour to bring this to you, to ſpeak for you what it never thought.</p>
            <p>And here in two things you greatly erre.</p>
            <p>The promiſes in Scripture made to the Church in generall, you apply to a particular Church, or to a part of the
<pb facs="tcp:40728:19"/> Catholique Church, namely, to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: Not ſufficiently conſidering what became of Jeruſalem, where our Lord preached, and where the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preached, and founded a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church (before ever, if ever, he ſaw Rome) notwithſtanding all the promiſes made either to the Church in generall, to the Jewiſh Church, or to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> or to the Church founded by him in particular.</p>
            <p>The promiſes made to <hi>Peter</hi> (and, that 'tis ſaid, before he was Pope) you apply, in part at leaſt, to the Biſhops of Rome; yea will have them reach the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſors, and ſtand them in ſteed, and in ſome things too wherein they did not ſecure <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe (to keep him from falling) namely, for their making alwaies an outward confeſſion of the Faith: for ye know <hi>Peter</hi> did in word deny his maſter.</p>
            <p>The truth is, diverſe Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſuch as the Communion in one kind, prayers and ſervice in an unknown tongue, making Images of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:40728:20"/> worſhipping of them, &amp;c. are ſo plainly contrary to the Scriptures, that 'tis your carnall intereſt if you will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe Doctrins, to deny, or at leaſt to undervalue the Authority of theſe in compariſon of the preſent Church.</p>
            <p>As for us, as we highly and above all extoll the teſtimony of Scripture, ſo neither doe we think our ſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuppreſſe or ſilence the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> three or four hundred yeers; only we would not admit <hi>ſuppoſititious writings,</hi> or teſtimonies, the baſe brats of latter times, for the <hi>true children</hi> of the antient <hi>Fathers;</hi> nor would we have the preſent Church of Rome, by her <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatory Index's</hi> &amp; corrupt gloſſes, &amp;c. to teach the Fathers to ſpeak now, and that what they never meant. And as you diſhonour the Fathers in laying ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-works at their doores, ſo have you wronged the Canon of the Scriptures, by advancing the Apocrypha books into the ſame chaire and throne with them: and in this how you have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:40728:20"/> the Ancient Fathers and Councels,<note place="margin">D.C.</note> a late Author hath ſhewed very well.</p>
            <p>And yet this is remarkable, that the pretended Councel of Trent have made a rod for their own backs: I mean, they have added the book of <hi>Baruch,</hi> and the Epiſtle of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Baruch,</hi> to the Canon: and there, as in a glaſſe, they may ſee what a whores fore-head the Church of Rome hath, to commit Idolatry with ſtocks &amp; ſtones, doing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the ſame things to their Images, that the Heathens, the old Babylonians, did to their Idols or Images.</p>
            <p>Heare D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Weſtfield;</hi> The Gentiles were wont to bow down to their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo doe the Papiſts: the Gentiles were wont to pray to them, ſo doe the Papiſts: the Gentiles were wont to render thanks to them, ſo doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: the Gentiles were wont to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves, and all that they had, to their Idols, ſo doe the Papiſts: the Gentiles nuncupated vowes to them, ſo do the Papiſts: the Gentiles were wont to ſweare by them, ſo doe the Papiſts:
<pb facs="tcp:40728:21"/> the Gentiles were wont to ſet up can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to them, ſo doe the Papiſts: The Gentiles were wont to burne incenſe to them, ſo doe the Papiſts. So he; and I doe not know that there is any one, who hath anſwered this charge ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Weſtfields Serm: p.</hi> 64. 65. Such like 'tis not improbable, is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne practiſe of the common people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Papacy. I have heard to this effect, that when the late King was in Spain, reaſoning againſt worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with a Prieſt, who denying the charg, it was agreed betwixt them, to take the next Perſon they found at devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their Churches for an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Prieſt beſpake the Perſon, a woman, to this purpoſe, <hi>Good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, you doe not pray to this Image or Saint, but to God in it:</hi> I but I doe, ſaith the woman, and will doe, till you ſhew me a better.</p>
            <p>Till the yeer 788. Images were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appointed publickly to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Churches, and this was done in the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> Charles

               <hi>Weſtfeild pag.</hi> 60. 61.</p>
            <p>If you ſay then, where was our Church, or Religion before <hi>Luther?</hi> and call us to give a catalogue in all ages of men profeſſing our Faith and way of worſhip, and that the Fathers and all Antiquity were yours; Heare I pray you, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Du Moulin;</hi> This reproach of novelty ill becomes the mouthes of thoſe perſons, which hide the true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity from the people, which is the word of God; and which maintain, that yet at this day, the Church may, and can make new ordinances touching Faith; and which by the Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no other than the Romiſh Church; that in the firſt ages after the Apoſtles, cannot produce one man that was of their Religion; and which know that in
<pb facs="tcp:40728:22"/> all Antiquity there is no mention made of excluding the people from the cup, of prohibiting them the reading of the Holy Scriptures, of reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to the people in a language they underſtand not, of painting the Trinity, of worſhipping Images, of adoring the hoaſt with the worſhip of <hi>Latria,</hi> of private Maſſes, of the Biſhop of Romes Court, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If you will have us tell more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly who were of our Religion before <hi>Luther,</hi> know that Chriſt and the holy Apoſtles were; and as for other names of particular perſons, who held with us in the Doctrines above named, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe other materiall Doctrines, the Proteſtants referre you to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There was a Reformation deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> repreſented their hundred grievances to the <hi>Emperour.</hi> But what <hi>mighty men</hi> could not, God hath brought about by <hi>mean men:</hi> nor needed <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and the reſt, any Commiſſions extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſealed with the broad ſeales of new miracles, to authorize his, or their proclaiming the laws and edicts of the great God, the King of Heaven.

Beſides, ſeeing that the Reformers did preach the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, and ſet up the ſame way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which they did, all which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

            <p>The Papiſts will ſometimes brag of their <hi>Charity;</hi> they give perhaps a piece of bread to ſome of our poor, and yet unchurch us poore and rich: they would not ſtick (I feare) had they power in their hands, to burne our bodies, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>we are Hereticks;</hi> and they doe as much as in them lyes to damne our ſoules: and if this be their <hi>charity,</hi> Oh my ſoule <hi>come not thou into their ſecrets.</hi>

            <p>Oh that God would perſwade your hearts to come to haſt out of Romiſh Babylon, that ye partake not of her ſins, and of her plagues at the laſt. Depart, depart from the tents of theſe men, come over I beſeech you unto us, and be ſafe, if you believe and obey. Be not deceived, be not blindfolded, ſearch and try whether the holy Scriptures, whether the Lord Chriſt, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans, or the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:40728:28"/> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtles to the Hebrewes, ever made the Church of Rome the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>miſtreſſe</hi> of all Churches, and to whom we muſt come, and whom we muſt believe, even without the word, or we cannot poſſibly be ſaved. See whether it be expreſly laid down in Scripture, that ever <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome; but judge in your ſelves, if he ſate Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there 25 yeers, whether or no it was not very probable that <hi>Paul</hi> would in ſome of his Epiſtles, which he wrote thence, have made mention of him: and what did the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> forſake <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when he was at Rome, and ſtood for the defence of the Goſpell (if <hi>Peter</hi> was there at that time) for <hi>Paul</hi> complaines ſaying, <hi>All men forſook me,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16.</p>
            <p>Or if <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of Rome, what then could none be ſaved for 3, or 4, or 600 yeers after Chriſt, becauſe the Pope was not 'till then owned as the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Paſtor</hi> of the Church, no nor did 'till then claime the title of <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Biſhop?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were there not three Popes at a time,
<pb facs="tcp:40728:29"/> and all three depoſed by the Council of <hi>Conſtance?</hi> yea 'tis a commonly cited ſaying of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, Biſhop of Rome, that he that had that title was <hi>praecurſor Antichriſti,</hi> or forerunner of Antichriſt. Yea how came the Biſhop of Rome to claime a power over other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, more than <hi>Peter</hi> did over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles? or how come <hi>Peter's</hi> ſucceſſors (ſuppoſe the Biſhop of Rome be ſo) to ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in his power &amp; priviledges, &amp; not other Biſhops, who ſucceeded the other Apoſtles in their Churches, to have the power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which thoſe Apoſtles had whom they ſucceeded? yea how came the Church at Jeruſalem, where Chriſt himſelfe preached in perſon, where <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had a ſpeciall hand in laying as it were the foundation, or planting of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, after Chriſt was aſcended, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38, 41. how comes that Church to erre, to fall away, and yet the Church of Rome to be infallible?</p>
            <p>Shew us if you can, either plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or Father, or Council for 4 or
<pb facs="tcp:40728:29"/> 500 yeers, that interpreted Scripture ſo, that Rome was infallible, and all were for ever to receive their faith from her mouth under paine of a curſe and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and that too when ſhe commands contrary to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and to the Doctrine contained in the Scriptures, as ſhe doth in her denying the cup to the people, in latine ſervice, where the people doe not underſtand it, in forbidding Prieſts marriage, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Oh that ye would lay aſide prejudice and diſaffection, and apply your ſelves to the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures; think never the better of Mahumetaniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, becauſe it muſt not be queſtioned, nor of Popery, becauſe 'tis death in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spaine</hi> without recantation, to read a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Bible without a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: how abſurd are theſe men to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der children from looking into their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Teſtament, or to forbid men to obey God, except they have firſt got mens leave ſo to doe. Let not your Prieſts perſwade you to lay out of your hands the holy Scripture, and to fill
<pb facs="tcp:40728:30"/> them with <hi>Legends and Fables,</hi> to put out the <hi>Sun in the firmament,</hi> that, you may ſee with their <hi>candles or glow-wormes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! doe not throw away the light of the Word, nor put out your own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>candle of the Lord,</hi> to follow your blind guides in the darkneſſe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as ye would not fall into the ditch, and into the pit. Oh! that you would not <hi>deſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> that you would pleaſe to read and conſider this plain <hi>Catechiſticall confutation</hi> of your errors (I hope) by pat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Scriptures. I have read how a plain country-man with one text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture convinced an erroneous Perſon, when great Schollars, and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting and reaſoning could not doe.</p>
            <p>My deſire and prayer is, that this Treatiſe may have the like effect, that the Scriptures here cited may convince thoſe who have erred from the truth, and may <hi>turne them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan and of Error unto God.</hi> Oh! how glad ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:40728:30"/> I be, if I could but undeceive and ſave ſome of you by this meanes, if I could pluck <hi>you as fire-brands out of the fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly my deſire and prayer is, and ſhall be (if the will of God be ſo) that ye may be in God's way, <hi>i. e.</hi> read his word, believe and obey it, that ye may be ſaved. And one thing let me ſay, think to be ſaved by your own Faith, and not meerly by believing as the Church believes: doe not truſt in God for ſalvation by an <hi>Atturney,</hi> as ye would not be contented to be ſaved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a <hi>Proxey.</hi> And be not amuſed with a great noiſe, and great names of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councils, which they that boaſt doe it (ſaith one) becauſe they know you cannot, or have not leiſure either to read or underſtand, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſprove them; ſee <hi>Moulin:</hi> but <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony, and the word is neer thee:</hi> and of the Bible I am ſure I may ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and that underſtandeth the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſeek not yours but you, and oh that
<pb facs="tcp:40728:31"/> you could or would away with your dungie and droſſy errors, and that you might keep your gold and ſilver; and on condition you would part with two parts of your errors, I hope I ſhould not envy you your whole eſtates.</p>
            <p>Yet ſay not that our <hi>Religion is cruel,</hi> and that you are <hi>Martyrs</hi> for yours; becauſe 'tis the <hi>cauſe,</hi> not the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> or ſuffering, makes a <hi>Martyr;</hi> and you ſuffer in your purſes for the Error of your Conſciences. I hope we <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> ſhall never be put to try, yet we could have no ſuch bargaine, if the law was in your hands; although the truth is, you pay too deare for a <hi>falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> for I may ſay of Religion, as of the Prophet <hi>Jeremys</hi> figs, <hi>the good is very good, and the bad very bad:</hi> if it be true, a man cannot pay too deare for it; if falſe, he cannot buy it too cheap.</p>
            <p>Now who would be of ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which may coſt him the certaine loſſe of a <hi>temporall,</hi> and much hazard his <hi>eternall eſtate;</hi> that will ruine his <hi>eſtate;</hi> and endanger his <hi>ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40728:31"/>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.35, 36, 37.

               <p>Q. <hi>May a man</hi> repeat <hi>and anſwer the</hi> objection <hi>of adverſaries, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth? or</hi> propound <hi>ſuch as he thinks the wiſdome of the fleſh will, or

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19, 20. Nay, but O man who art thou that replyeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? in v. 19. thou wilt ſay then unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is it in any caſe lawfull to</hi> ſet down <hi>the objection, or Argument of erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or hereticall Perſons?</hi>

Then came to him certaine of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, which deny that there is any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and they asked him, ſaying, Maſter, <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote unto us, if any man's Brother dye, having a wife, and he dye without children, that his Brother ſhould take his wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his Brother: there were therefore ſeven brethren, and the firſt took a wife, and dyed without children, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Reſurrection, whoſe wife of them is ſhe? for ſeven had her to wife.

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18, 19, 27, 28. I thank my God, I ſpeak with tongues more

               <p>Q. <hi>IS faith in Chriſt required of thoſe who ſhall be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe</hi> on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 36. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever <hi>believeth</hi> in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40728:65"/> life. He that <hi>believeth</hi> on the Son hath everlaſting life, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Son ſhall not ſee life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that great truth to which the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. And this is the record that God hath given to us eternall life, and this life is in his Sonne.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is it neceſſary that we ſhould</hi> repent <hi>of our ſinnes, and reforme or amend our lives, and forſake our ſinnes, if we will have mercy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent</hi> ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſinnes may be blotted out, when the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are any ſo predeſtinated, or did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo lay down his life for any particular Perſons, that although they live and dye in</hi> impenitency <hi>and</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, <hi>yet they ſhall ſurely be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Rom.</hi> 8.1, 13, 30. There is therefore now no condemnation to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walke not after the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40728:66"/> fleſh, but after the Spirit. For if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye; but if ye through the Spirit doe mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live. Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate them he alſo called, and whom he called them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſtified, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth the Scriptures hold out any ſuch</hi> preterition, <hi>or Non-election, or ſo hold forth the death of Chriſt, that ſome perſons although they believe with all their heart, and repent, and forſake all their ſins, yet ſhall not be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Joh. 3.36. He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35, 43. Of a truth I perceive, God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nation he that feareth him and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth righteouſneſſe is accepted with him. To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his name whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of Sinnes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May we be ſure if we believe, that we were</hi> ordained <hi>to eternall life?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40728:66"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Act.</hi> 13.48. And as many as were <hi>ordained</hi> to eternall life believed. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. But we are bound to give thanks to God alway for you brethren, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning <hi>choſen</hi> you to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What manner of Perſons are thoſe, living and dying, who were of old</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>unto condemnation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Jude.</hi> 4. For there are certaine men crept in unawares, who were before of old <hi>ordained</hi> to this condemnation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, turning the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſſe, and denying the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May our Election be</hi> known?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Wherefore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure, for if ye doe theſe things ye ſhall never fall. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Knowing</hi> brethren, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, your election of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth God elect or chuſe men out of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40728:67"/> Grace, and that they might he</hi> holy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Rom.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6. There is a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the <hi>Election of Grace.</hi> And if by <hi>Grace,</hi> then is it no more of <hi>works,</hi> otherwiſe grace is no more Grace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be <hi>holy,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before him in love. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. God hath from the beginning cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are we commanded to</hi> believe <hi>in the name of the Lord Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. And this is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, This is the word of God, that ye believe on him, whom he hath ſent.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Have we power of our ſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to doe good works?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Eph.</hi> 2.8. For by grace are ye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. For unto you it is given in the behalfe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40728:67"/>of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who is the Author and finiſher of our Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Heb.</hi> 12.2. Looking unto Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our Faith, &amp;c. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. Lord I believe, help thou mine unbeliefe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Seeing we cannot believe and doe good works by our own power, may we be exhorted to both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. Wherefore my beloved, as you have alwaies obeyed, &amp;c. Worke out your own Salvation with feare and trembling; For it is God which worketh in you both <hi>to will</hi> &amp; <hi>to doe</hi> of his good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is there an Almighty power put forth to make us believe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Eph.</hi> 1.19. And what is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſſe of his power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who believe, according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his mighty power.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is it our duty to convert and turne to God, &amp;c.?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. Waſh ye, make you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40728:68"/> cleane, put away the evill of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doe evill, learne to doe well, ſeek judgment, relieve the opreſſed, judg the fatherleſſe, plead for the widdow. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſinnes may be blotted out. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.12. Turne ye even to me ſaith the Lord with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are we able of our ſelves to turne, or muſt we pray unto God to turne us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pſal.</hi> 85.4. Turne us O God of our Salvation, and cauſe thine anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us to ceaſe. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the</hi> word of God <hi>a means or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which God uſeth to convert men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. For our <hi>Goſpel</hi> came not unto you in word only, but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance: and ye became followers
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40728:68"/> of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghoſt. So <hi>v.</hi> 9. For they themſelves ſhew of us what manner of entring in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from Idols, to ſerve the living and true God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the word a means to work Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Rom. 10.17. So then Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by <hi>hearing,</hi> &amp; hearing by the word of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is a man juſtified partly by Faith, and partly by works?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Rom.</hi> 3.28. Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is that of James</hi> chap. 2.24. <hi>to be underſtood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Jam.</hi> 2.17, 18. Even ſo Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone, yea a man may ſay, Thou haſt faith, &amp; I have works: ſhew me thy Faith without thy works, &amp; I will ſhew thee my faith by my works, <hi>i.e.</hi> Faith, that doth not ſhew it ſelfe by good works to be alive, is a dead faith.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40728:69"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>Shall any that are elected, juſtified, &amp; ſanctified, ever fall</hi> wholy, <hi>and</hi> finally <hi>from Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.24. For there ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, &amp;c. and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, inſomuch that <hi>(if it were poſſible)</hi> they ſhall deceive the very Elect. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Who are kept by the power of God, through Faith, unto Salvation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28, 29. I give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all: and no man is <hi>able</hi> to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Shall any regenerate perſon, any child of God,</hi> continue <hi>in ſin,</hi> allow <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to goe on cuſtomarily in any way of ſinne and wickedneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Whatſoever is borne of God doth not <hi>commit ſinne;</hi> for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he <hi>cannot</hi> ſin, becauſe he is borne of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23, 24. Search me O God, and know my heart, try me, &amp; know my thoughts,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40728:69"/> and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Did our Lord Chriſt dye that ſinners being juſtified, might live as they liſt, or that they ſhould live</hi> holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.?</p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. He that committeth ſinne is of the Divel; for the Devill ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the beginning: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the workes of the Devil. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. Unto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſſe you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the Goſpel, or the Doctrine of ſalvation, as 'tis taught in the Scriptures, a Doctrine according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. If a man teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40728:70"/> and conſent not to wholſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Doctrine which is according to godlineſſe. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And without controverſy great is the myſtery of godlineſſe. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. For the grace of God, that bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is any man in this life ſo</hi> perfect, that he is without all ſin?</p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8, 10. If we ſay that we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us. If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a lyar, and his word is not in us. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.46. If they ſinne againſt thee, for there is no man that ſinneth not, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. Who can ſay I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſinne? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. For there is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good, and ſinneth not. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. For in many things we offend all.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:40728:70"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>May we know, that if a man prove an</hi> Apoſtate, <hi>and fall</hi> wholy, <hi>and</hi> for ever <hi>away, that he was never truly juſtified and regenerated?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have <hi>continued</hi> with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24, 25. Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, which built his houſe upon a rocke; and the raine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon the houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Can any man come to Chriſt except the Father</hi> draw <hi>him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Joh.</hi> 6.44. No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath ſent me, <hi>draw</hi> him, and I will raiſe him up at the Laſt day.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May we pray to God to draw us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Cant.</hi> 1.4. Draw me, we will run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40728:71"/> thee: the King hath brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What Scripture grounds have men to liſten after, to prize, to be in love with the</hi> Goſpel, <hi>and to eſteem it as worthy of all acceptation, and ſo to hunger and thirſt after the good things contained in it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Joh.</hi> 3.16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief: Howbeit for this cauſe I obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to them which ſhould hereafter believe on him to life everlaſting. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.10. For therefore we both labour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that believe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. And him that cometh to me I
<pb facs="tcp:40728:71"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:40728:72"/>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40728:72"/> will in no wiſe caſt out. <hi>He.</hi> 7.25. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able to ſave them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>If a man really hunger and thirſt after Chriſt to be his</hi> Saviour, <hi>and to be his</hi> Soveraigne, <hi>is he then under any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Mat.</hi> 5.6. Bleſſed are they which doe hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for they ſhall be filled.</p>

               <p>A. See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4.30. And when thou art ſpoiled, what wilt thou doe? though thou clotheſt thy ſelfe with crimſon, though thou deckeſt thee with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gold, though thou renteſt thy

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the beſt meanes for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have and hold her husbands affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? is not the feare of God, and meek &amp; diſcreet carriage towards her husband?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.30. Favour is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and beauty is vaine: but a woman that feareth the Lord ſhe ſhall be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 3, 4.

In thoſe Eaſterne hot countryes they did uſe oile frequently to anoint themſelves withall, poſſibly to make their skin ſmooth and cleare, free from beeing too much dried and parched, and ſo wrinkled before 'its time, and to make them have a chearfull countenance; they took oile perhaps inwardly, and they uſed it outwardly, anointing their heads, and perhaps their faces too for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes aforeſaid, &amp; it may be too, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume themſelves, and this was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of men, and of good men too. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20.

               <p>Q. <hi>Is the ſpirit given that we may live</hi> without <hi>or</hi> above <hi>Gods commandements and</hi> ordinances?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, 20. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them, — that they may walke

For if that which is done away was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, much more that which <hi>remaineth</hi> is glorious.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What if a man have the ſpirit, be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ſpirit, be a ſtrong Chriſtian, is he to</hi> caſt off ordinances, <hi>and offices in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.5. And the ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, &amp; they choſe Stephen, a man <hi>full of faith,</hi> and of the H. Ghoſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44, 47, 48. While Peter yet ſpake theſe words the Holy Ghoſt fell
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40728:115"/> on all them which heard the word. Then anſwered <hi>Peter,</hi> can any man forbid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that theſe ſhould not be <hi>baptized,</hi> which have received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What Anſwer ſhall we give to thoſe Scriptures, Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1, 9?</p>
               <p>A. To that place in the Hebrewes, I ſay, 1 That it muſt not be interpreted to forbid the uſe of all ordinances, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by men; for the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did notwithſtanding this promiſe go on teaching, and ordaining teachers in the Churches. 2 That if this text of Scripture ſhould be taken, as it ſeems to ſound in the expreſſe words and letter of it, it will make void and needleſſe not only <hi>publick</hi> teaching, and by miniſters or Church-officers, but alſo <hi>private</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and by private friends, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, brethren, not miniſters. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, I ſay, that the ſenſe and meaning may be, that they ſhall have not only the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> teaching of men, but the <hi>inward</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:40728:115"/> teaching of the ſpirit; and this teaching of God by his ſpirit they ſhall have in ſuch a manner and meaſure, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward ſhall be nothing or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in compariſon: or 4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, They ſhall in Goſpell times from the leaſt to the greateſt know God the Lord to be the Lord, and they ſhall not teach them, as if they were to teach a heatheniſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing people: but the miniſters ſhall then teach a more knowing people; as tis ſaid, the Earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the ſea, (i. e.) there ſhall be abundance of knowledge beyond what there is now generally.</p>
               <p>To that in 1 Epiſtle of John, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is either this, You are ſufficiently already inſtructed in this, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, you need not a farther proof in that matter; the ſeducers, Anti-Chriſts, or falſe Chriſts, ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw you away from this great truth. Or elſe, ye that are the children of God, have the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit in ſuch a meaſure, that ye ſhall not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40728:116"/> be carried away from the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or the truth as tis in Jeſus, but this Spirit ſhall teach you in all neceſſary &amp; ſaving truths. And that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this place, this Apoſtle writes this Epiſtle to informe them, &amp; to edify the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>To that in 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſenſe and ſcope of the words may be this, that you may find the knowledge of God, and of his Chriſt, if you will read, and conſider, and compare the propheſies of the old Teſtament: for thoſe Scriptures teſtify of him. The meaning is not, that when you have got the knowledge of Chriſt, you need not further to take heed to the Scriptures: when the godly <hi>Pſ.</hi> 123.2. profeſſe to look or waite on God untill he have mercy on them, doe you think that they meant to look or waite on him juſt ſo long, and no longer?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May miniſters preſſe Saints, who</hi> live <hi>and</hi> dwell <hi>in God, and who are</hi> taught <hi>of God, to hearken to a word or</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>without them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9. But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you: for ye your ſelves are <hi>taught</hi> of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40728:116"/> of God to love one another: compared with the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. For ye know what <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> we gave you by the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1, 2. Children obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father &amp; mother (which is the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement with promiſe) compared with <hi>ch.</hi> 1.1. Paul an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the will of God, to the <hi>Saints</hi> which are at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and to the faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8, 11. If ye fulfill the royall Law according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelfe, ye do well.

               <p>A. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. And I beheld ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt coming up out of the earth, and he had two hornes like a lamb, and he ſpake as a dragon &amp;c. compared with ch. 14.1, 3. And I looked, and loe a lamb ſtood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, having his fathers name written in their foreheads: and they ſung as it were a new ſong before the throne, and before the four beaſts, and the Elders, and no man could learne that ſong, but the hundred forty and foure thouſand, which were redeemed from the earth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When the glorious times of the Church, ſpoken of by</hi> Iſaiah ch. laſt. <hi>come, will there be uſe of</hi> Miniſters <hi>and</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?</p>

               <p>A. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19, 20.

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.2. And when they heard that he ſpake in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue to them, they kept the more ſilence. And <hi>Acts</hi> 21.37. And as Paul was to be led into the Caſtle, he ſaid unto the chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, may I ſpeak unto thee? who ſaid, canſt thou ſpeak <hi>Greek?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3.

               <p>Q. <hi>If Miniſters have the</hi> ſpirit of God, <hi>doth it follow therefore that they muſt know all things</hi> perfectly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. For we <hi>know in part,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6, 7. And it came to paſſe when they were come, that he looked on <hi>Eliab,</hi> and ſaid, ſurely the Lords anointed is before him. But the Lord ſaid unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his ſtature, becauſe I have refuſed him: for the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth; for man looketh on the <hi>outward appearance,</hi> but the Lord looketh on the heart. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 14. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be <hi>blamed.</hi> But when I ſaw that they walked not <hi>uprightly</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of the Goſpell, I ſaid unto Peter before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, If thou being a Jew liveſt after the manner of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, &amp; not as do the Jewes, why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleſt

               <p>Q. <hi>How may we prove that thoſe</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>which are contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, are not from the holy ſpirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13, 14. Howbeit, when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelfe.— He ſhall glorify me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did Chriſt approve of</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>and</hi> Miniſters, <hi>their continuance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was gone to heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 5, 20. John to the 7 Churches in Aſia, grace be unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come. — And from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the firſt begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: —The myſtery of the 7 Stars, which thou ſaweſt in my right hand, and the 7 golden Candleſticks. The 7 Stars are the <hi>Angels</hi> of the 7 Churches, and the 7 Candleſticks which thou ſaweſt,

               <p>Q. <hi>How long are there to be</hi> Churches, <hi>and Miniſters, and</hi> Ordinances?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Math.</hi> 28. laſt. And loe I am with you <hi>alwaies,</hi> even unto <hi>the end of the world.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.22. —deſpiſe ye the Church of God?— ſhall I praiſe you in this, I praiſe you not, v. 26. for as often as ye eate this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death <hi>till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May men</hi> adminiſter ordinances, <hi>viz. Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper, who have not extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.41. And many reſorted unto him, and ſaid, John did no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: but all things that John ſpake of this man were true.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the</hi> gift of tongues <hi>or</hi> miracles <hi>among the requiſite qualifications of a Biſhop or Miniſter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. A Biſhop then muſt be blameleſſe, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour, given to hoſpitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40728:120"/> not greedy of filthy lucre, but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not a brawler, not covetous, one that ruleth well his owne houſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his children in ſubjection with all gravity, not a novice, leſt &amp;c. moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he muſt have a good report of them which are without, leſt he fall into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the ſnare of the Devill. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9. If any be blameleſſe, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife, having faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not accuſed of riot, or unruly: for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe, as the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of God: not ſelfe-willed, not ſoon angry, not given to wine, no ſtriker, not given to filthy lucre, but a lover of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, a lover of good men, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate, holding faſt the faithfull word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doctrine both to exhort, and convince the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May a man</hi> receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>who hath not the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt in abundance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. Yes. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.14 15, 16, 17. When the Apoſtles — heard that Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40728:120"/> had received the word of God, they ſent unto them Peter and John; who when they were come down prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt, for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were babtized in the name of the Lord Jeſus. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the H. Ghoſt. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.26. And as they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the diſciples, &amp;c. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the word of God to be</hi> read <hi>in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.16. And when this Epiſtle is <hi>read</hi> amongſt you, cauſe that it be read alſo in the Church of the Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans, and that ye likewiſe <hi>read</hi> the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle from Laodicea.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the Sacrament of the</hi> Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>yet to be adminiſtred in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11.20, 21, 33, 34. When
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40728:121"/> ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for in eating every one taketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other his own ſupper: and one is hungry, another is drunken. Wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eate, tarry one for another. And if any man hunger, let him eate at home, that ye come not together unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May the Church meet for holy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?</p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31, 34, 35. For ye may all propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. Let your women keep ſilence in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, — for it is a ſhame for women to ſpeak in the Church.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May the Church deny to have</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <hi>with brethren, if they are</hi> ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous <hi>perſons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11, 12. But now I have written unto you not to <hi>keep company,</hi> if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40728:121"/> with ſuch a one, no, not to eate: — do not ye judge them that are within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. May particular congregations, who ordinarily meet together for worſhip, be called</hi> Churches?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. And when they had ordained them Elders in every <hi>Church,</hi> and had prayed with faſting, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the Lord. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. For this cauſe have I ſent unto you Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus —who ſhall bring you into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my waies, which be in Chriſt, as I teach every where, in every <hi>Church.</hi> ch. 14.23. If therefore the whole <hi>Church</hi> be come together into one place, and all ſpeak with tongues &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May the believers of one city or country, although they have many ſeverall Paſtors or teachers over them, be called a</hi> Church?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. And from Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus he ſent to Epheſus, and called the Elders of the <hi>Church.</hi> Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the H.

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:40728:122"/> of God, which he hath purchaſed with his owne bloud.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do all the Churches, or believers in them, make up</hi> one Church <hi>of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. And he is the head of the body the <hi>Church,</hi> who is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the firſt borne from the dead.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May the Elders and brethren of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall churches meet and conferre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about queſtions, or matters of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which may ariſe amongſt them, or any of them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 2, 6, 7. And certaine men which came down from Judea, taught the brethren, and ſaid, except ye be circumciſed after the manner of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ye cannot be ſaved. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul and Barnabas had no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion and diſputation with them, they determined that Paul, and Barnabas, and certaine others of them, ſhould go up to Jeruſalem unto the Apoſtles and Elders about this Queſtion. And the Apoſtles and Elders came together, for to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this matter. And when there had been much diſputing, Peter roſe up,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40728:122"/> and ſaid unto them &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are the multitude of believers to be</hi> ſatisfied, <hi>if it may be, in thoſe matters in queſtion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.30, 31. So when they were diſmiſſed, they came to Antioch, and when they had gathered the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude together, they delivered the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; which when they had read, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced for the conſolation.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May the multitude have a hand or voice in the</hi> choice <hi>of church officers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2, 3, 5. Then the twelve called the multitude of the Diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and ſaid, &amp;c. wherefore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren look ye out among you 7 men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſdome, whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe.

               <p>A. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.3, 4, 5. Now for a long ſeaſon Iſrael hath been without the true God, and without a teaching Prieſt, and without Law: But when they in their trouble did turne unto the Lord God of Iſrael, and ſought him, he was found of them. And in thoſe times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countryes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doe people ſay well, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well ſince there was ſo much preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? or that the olden time, as they ſpeak, was better than theſe times?</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>If it ſhould be granted that there
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40728:132"/> was more peace and plenty in times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery than ſince the Reformation, doth it therefore neceſſarily follow, that God was pleaſed with that Religion, or that that was the true way of worſhip?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, 18, 20, 21. But we will certainly doe whatſoever thing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth out of our mouth, to burne incenſe unto the Queen of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done.—For then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and ſaw no evill. But ſince we left off to burne incenſe to the Queen of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been conſumed by the ſword, and by the famine. The incenſe that ye burnt in the cities of Judah—did not the Lord remember them, and came it not into his mind? ſo that the Lord could noe longer beare, becauſe of the evill of your doings, and becauſe of the abominations which ye have committed: therefore is your land a deſolation, and an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a curſe, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9, 10, 15. But a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord was there, whoſe name was <hi>Oded,</hi> and he went out before the hoſt that came to Samaria, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Behold, becauſe the Lord God of your Fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have ſlain them in a rage that reacheth up to heaven. And now ye purpoſe to keep under the children of Judah and Jeruſalem for bond-men and bond-women unto you; but are there not with you, even with you, ſins againſt the Lord your God, &amp;c. And the men which were expreſſed by name roſe up, and took the captives, and with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40728:135"/> the ſpoile clothed all that were naked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and arrayed them, and ſhod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and annointed them, and carryed all the feeble of them upon Aſſes, and brought them to Jericho the city of Palm-trees to their Brethren.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ſay we to the ſeventh of</hi> Deut. 2. <hi>and chap.</hi> 20.16. <hi>in relation to the</hi> Canaanites; <hi>and to the</hi> 13 <hi>of</hi> Deut. 15. <hi>in reference to the Apoſtate Iſraelites?</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> In caſe God have a worke to doe, ſuppoſe to deſtroy his implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Moabites, if God make known his mind by his Prophets, as to <hi>Saul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Amalekites. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.3.

               <p>A. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.6, 7. At the mouth of 2 or 3 witneſſes ſhall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witneſſe he ſhall not be put to death; the hands of the witneſſes ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people: ſo thou ſhalt put the evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from among you <hi>i. e.</hi> They may be witneſſes againſt ſuch offenders, and be cauſers of their death in a legall way.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Did not</hi> Phinehas <hi>out of zeale kill</hi> Zimri <hi>and</hi> Cosbi <hi>in the act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe? and is he not commended and rewarded for ſo doing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Either <hi>Phinehas</hi> was an officer, or had commiſſion from <hi>Moſes,</hi> the chief Magiſtrate, as the Levites had formerly in another caſe: or he was moved and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40728:136"/> carried to this execution by a ſpeciall motion and inſtinct of the ſpirit of God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.26, 27. <hi>Num.</hi> 25.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Did not</hi> Elijah <hi>ſlay the Prieſts of</hi> Baal 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.40?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Elijah</hi> was an extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, wrought many miracles, and at that time God had anſwered him by fire from heaven to conſume his ſacrifice, and to confute the Idolatrous Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> and this in the ſight of Iſrael gathered together by the command of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab:</hi> and poſſibly the King too might be preſent at this time; becauſe in the next verſe, immediately after mention is made of <hi>Elijah's</hi> ſlaying the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> it followes <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a ſound of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of rain: and who knowes but the King might <hi>tacitly</hi> conſent, if not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi> and openly, to this execution of Juſtice, and the people might be ayding thereunto; having profeſſedly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Lord to be the God, in <hi>v.</hi> 39. and if the King, and people at leaſt, had not aſſented, and ſome of them aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40728:136"/> how could one <hi>Elijah</hi> have ſlayn 400? Beſides, whether he, or they, they did but execute upon them the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 18.20. A like execution did <hi>Jehu</hi> by his Captaines and Guards upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Baal, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.25. And now I deſire all <hi>Quakers</hi> &amp; <hi>Antiminiſte ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> who account the Miniſters of the Goſpel as Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> would hold their hands from blood, untill all the people be gathered together, and before them it be tryed whether they or we be in the right. Beſides, <hi>Elijah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet cal'd for fire from heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume two Captaines and their fiftyes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. Will any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude wildly, that we may call for fire from heaven to conſume all the Captaines and their companies, when they come to apprehend us? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were miſtaken in miſapplying this inſtance of <hi>Elijah,</hi> Luk. 9.55. And therefore no ſo great marvel if light heads be ſoon on fire againſt us from their miſcarrying ſuch a ſparke of truth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40728:137"/> as this, and therewith (if let alone) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to burne to Aſhes the preſent Churches and Miniſters, and think they doe God good ſervice.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is it not ſaid</hi> Rev. 16.6. <hi>For they have ſhed the blood of Saints and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. This was a Propheticall viſion of deſtruction to perſecutors; and poſſibly it might be in part fulfilled when Prieſts were adjudged to death, either in Popiſh countryes for ill-living, or elſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lawes made againſt them by the ſupreme powers amongſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. But what warrant is this for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, &amp; that againſt Law, to fall upon the perſons or eſtates of the true Miniſters of Chriſt? Oh that men would conſider that this Judgment is here denounced againſt men for ſhedding the blood of Prophets and of Saints! and obſerve, there is a diſtinction of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Saints, and that Prophets are put in the firſt place. Beſides, I ſay further, that the <hi>precepts</hi> of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40728:137"/> not the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> are to be our guide, and if we follow this light it will guide our feet into the wayes of peace.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Was it required by the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>that the Prieſts ſhould be</hi> conſulted <hi>withall, or made any uſe of, when they went forth to warre?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8, 9. And the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt ſhall blow with the trumpets, &amp;c. And if ye goe to warre in your land againſt the enemy that oppreſſeth you, then ye ſhall blow an alarum with the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and ye ſhall be remembred before the Lord your God, and ye ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from your enemies.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May Miniſters goe along and</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <hi>their brethren when they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight the Lord's battels, to help the Lord againſt the mighty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Deut. 20.2, 3, 4. And it ſhall be when ye are come nigh unto the Battell, that the Prieſt ſhall approach and ſpeak unto the people, and ſhall ſay unto them, Heare O Iſrael, you approach this day unto battell againſt your enemies, let
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40728:138"/> not your hearts faint, feare not, and doe not tremble, neither be ye terrified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you againſt your enemies to ſave you.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Was that a</hi> Centurion, <hi>or Captain of a</hi> 100, <hi>of whom the Jewes ſaid unto Chriſt, he hath loved our nation, and built us a Synagogue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.2. And a certaine Centurions Servant, who was deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, was ſick and ready to dye &amp;c. he hath loved our nation, and built us a Synagogue.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Did there ever a</hi> Colledge <hi>or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Prophets live quietly and</hi> peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>by a</hi> Garriſon <hi>of Souldiers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. After that thou ſhalt come to the hill of God, where is the garriſon of the Philiſtines: and it ſhall come to paſſe, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou ſhalt meet a company of Prophets, coming down from the high place with a Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and a Tabret, &amp; a Pipe, and a Harp before them, and they ſhall propheſie.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.9, 10, 11. The children of <hi>Ephraim</hi> being armed, and carrying bowes, turned back in the day of battell: They kept not the Covenant of God, and refuſed to walke in his law, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his works, and his wonders that he had ſhewed them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>VVhat effect had</hi> John Baptiſts <hi>preaching upon the Souldiers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.14. And the Souldiers likewiſe demanded of him, ſaying, And what ſhall we doe? And he ſaid unto them, Doe violence to no man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Ought Souldiers to</hi> enquire <hi>of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters the way of Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.22, 23. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, a juſt man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God by an holy Angell to ſend for thee into his houſe, and to heare words of thee.

               <p>Q. <hi>Doth not the ſcripture condemne</hi> Reſpect <hi>of perſons,</hi> Deut. 16.19. Jam. 2.1, 3, 9. Prov. 24.23. <hi>and</hi> 28.21.</p>
               <p>A. It is written alſo in the Scripture (and the Scripture cannot be broken) Render <hi>honour</hi> to whom honour is due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. And againe, Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, I am the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.32. We muſt not ſo expound one place of Scripture as to make it claſh with another. The holy ſpirit of truth doth not croſſe and contradict himſelfe. We muſt neceſſarily therefore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Reſpect of Perſons, and ſhew what manner of honour or reſpect is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and condemned, and what is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and allowed: we acknowledge that the Scripture forbids to reſpect perſons
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40728:144"/> in judgment, whether rich or poor, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.15. The Judge muſt not pervert judgment for feare of the rich man, or out of pitty to the poor man, but muſt judge righteous judgment, every man's cauſe not according to the perſon that mannages it, and whom it concernes, but according to the merit of it.</p>
               <p>Againe, Chriſtians muſt not as in the adminiſtration of juſtice, ſo neither of Ordinances, admit rich men becauſe they are rich, however unbelieving, unworthy, and altogether unqualified; and exclude or refuſe the poor, how rich ſoever in Faith, prepared, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, merely becauſe they are poor. It ſeemes when <hi>James</hi> wrote his Epiſtle there were ſome in the Church, who were to be blamed, becauſe they did preferre and honour rich men; though unbelievers and oppreſſros, and in the mean time did contemne and deſpiſe poor believing Chriſtians for their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. Though we may honour men for thoſe outward excellencies which God hath beſtowed or put upon them,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40728:145"/> yet we muſt never ſo honour the rich, as to ſlight and deſpiſe the poor, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the poor Believer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May we take theſe words</hi> Reſpect <hi>and</hi> Honour <hi>the one for the other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.15. Ye ſhall doe no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe in judgment: thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor honour the perſon of the mighty: but in Righteouſneſſe ſhalt thou judge thy Neighbour. To conclude this matter, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of <hi>reſpect of perſons,</hi> will appeare by comparing amongſt others theſe two places of Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.9.—know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> alſo is in heaven nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there reſpect of perſons with him, with <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4, 5. — And the Lord had reſpect unto <hi>Abel</hi> and to his offering: But unto <hi>Cain</hi> and to his offering he had not reſpect. To reconcile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that ſeem thus to croſſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſay God doth not regard men more for their beauty, place, eſtate, or ſuch outward things: nor will he for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch by-reſpect goe a haires breadth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40728:145"/> from juſtice, and in this ſence there is no reſpect of perſons with God. And yet God doth righteouſly and holily accept the faces of his people, that feare, and ſerve, and call upon him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.9. For I will have reſpect unto you, and make you fruitfull, and multiply you and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my Covenant with you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Is Heaven cal'd</hi> Paradiſe?</p>
               <p>A. Yes. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. I knew a man in Chriſt—ſuch a one caught up to the third Heaven: and I knew ſuch a man, — how that he was caught up into Paradiſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Can any mere man by his own good workes</hi> merit <hi>heaven or eternall life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Lu.</hi> 17.10. So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all theſe things, that are commanded you, ſay, we are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servants. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> For the wages of Sinne is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:40728:169"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the Church of Rome or the Pope</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible, <hi>becauſe of the promiſes made to</hi> Peter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As <hi>Herod</hi> might and did erre in cutting off <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts head, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he ſucceeded into the place of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> Kings of the Jewes, and notwithſtanding the ſaying that is written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.10. A divine ſentence is in the King's lips, his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in judgment. So the Biſhop of Rome, or the Church of Rome, or any other particular Church or perſon, may now erre, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what was once ſaid to <hi>Peter.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Jeſus Chriſt prayed that <hi>Peter</hi> might not fall from his Faith in Chriſt <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally,</hi> or that the Divel might not prevaile over him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he foreſaw he would ſhake him and winnow him ſore: and this latter promiſe was made good to <hi>Peter</hi> in his own perſon; for although through tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation he denyed Chriſt <hi>outwardly,</hi> yet it came not from his heart, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his denyal, and profeſſed and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40728:169"/> preached Chriſt afterward. And if this promiſe ſhould reach or belong to the Biſhop of Rome, as <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſour, it ſhould only prove, that the Biſhop of Rome ſhould not fall away <hi>utterly</hi> from the Faith, although ſometimes he ſhould deny it <hi>outwardly:</hi> For nothing can reaſonably be thought to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for <hi>Peter's</hi> pretended Succeſſour, which was not prayed for, and obtained for <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>As for the former promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter</hi> &amp;c. Underſtand it thus, that thou <hi>Peter</hi> ſhalt lay the firſt notable foundation of the Chriſtian Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Jewes and Gentiles, and this Chriſtian Church thus founded (by thee in a more eſpeciall manner) ſhall never be deſtroyed: and we read <hi>Act.</hi> 2. that <hi>Peter</hi> did moſt eminently and ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully firſt preach to, and convert the Jewes to Chriſtianity: and we read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <hi>Act.</hi> 10. that he did moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and ſucceſſefully firſt preach the Goſpell to, and convert the Gentiles to Chriſtianity: and accordingly there ſhall
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40728:170"/> be a Chriſtian Church thus, and in this ſenſe begun to be founded by him, ſo long as the world endures; nor ſhall the gates of hell be ever able wholly to root out Chriſtianity: but it is not promiſed that any particular Church, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Jewes or Gentiles, and whether that of Antioch or of Rome, founded by him under Chriſt, ſhall never <hi>wholly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatize</hi> from the Faith. This we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants confeſſe, that the Chriſtian faith or Doctrine was built or founded upon the preaching of the twelve Apoſtles of Chriſt, whereof Peter was one of the moſt eminent Pillars, or ſubordinate Founders or Foundations; and yet it muſt be remembred, that the reſt of the Apoſtles are called <hi>Foundations</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 14. And that our Lord Chriſt himſelfe is the chiefe Foundation, the <hi>Fundamentum fundamentorum,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch foundation can no man lay, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Was Peter's Succeſſour the Biſhop, or by any good conſequence, the Church of Rome, the Foundation ſtone to which all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40728:170"/> muſt be joyned and cemented, or elſe they will prove but looſe ſtones, or built on the ſand, or but fooliſh builders? or (to uſe the expreſsion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baxter) muſt</hi> Paul <hi>be damned, becauſe he was not one of</hi> Peter's <hi>ſubjects?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6. If ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gratious, to whom comming as unto a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, but cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God and precious, ye alſo as live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifice acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt: wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, Behold I lay in Sion a chiefe corner ſtone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on him ſhall not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Did Chriſt make Peter King, or Lord, and Ruler over the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.24, 25, 26. And there was alſo a ſtrife amongſt them which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt. And he ſaid unto them, the Kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40728:171"/> exerciſe Lordſhip over them, and they that exerciſe authority upon them are called Benefactors: But ye ſhall not be ſo; but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.21, 22. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeing him ſaith to Jeſus, Lord, and what ſhall this man doe? Jeſus ſaith unto him, If I will that he tarry 'till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6, 9. But of theſe who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſomewhat (whatſoever they were it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no man's perſon) for they who ſeemed to be ſomewhat, in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence added nothing to me. And when <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who ſeemed to be Pillars &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Did not Chriſt ſay to Peter,</hi> feed <hi>my Lambes, and</hi> feed <hi>my ſheep,</hi> Joh. 21.15, 16. <hi>And doth not this give</hi> Peter <hi>the power and priviledge of</hi> Univerſall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, <hi>and conſequently give the</hi> Pope <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of</hi> Univerſall Biſhop <hi>over the whole Church of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16, 19, 20. Then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40728:171"/> Diſciples went away into Galilee, &amp;c. Goe ye therefore and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatever I have commanded you, and lo I am with you alway. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, &amp; to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3. Feed the flock of God, which is among you, taking the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mind; neither as being Lords over God's heritage, but being enſamples to the flock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Was the Church of Rome appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the</hi> Head <hi>and</hi> Miſtris <hi>of all Churches by Chriſt? And did the Apoſtle John, the laſt ſurviving Apoſtle, apply himſelfe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. <hi>John</hi> to the 7 Churches
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40728:172"/> of Aſia, Grace be unto you &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Should it ſcare a Proteſtant from his Religion, becauſe the Papiſts ſay it is</hi> hereſy?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14, 16. But this I confeſſe unto thee, that after the way which they call <hi>hereſy,</hi> ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers.— And herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe to have alwaies a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Doth the Church of Rome at this day thwart the practiſe of the</hi> Primitive <hi>Church, recorded in Scripture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes. In their ſervice in an <hi>unknown tongue</hi> they contradict the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18, 19, 27, 28. I thank my God, I ſpeak with tongues more than you all; yet in the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue. If any man ſpeak in an unknowne tongue — let one interpret: but if there be no Interpreter, let him keep ſilence in the Church, and let him ſpeak to himſelfe and to God.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:40728:172"/>
               <p>In the peoples communicating in <hi>one kind</hi> only, namely, partaking of the bread, but not of the cup, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. After the ſame manner alſo he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This is the new teſtament in my blood, this doe ye as oft as ye drink it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. For as often as ye eate this bread, and drink this cup, ye doe ſhew the Lord's death 'till he come.</p>
               <p>In <hi>worſhipping of Angels, Col.</hi> 2.18. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and <hi>worſhipping of Angels</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.8, 9. And I <hi>John</hi> ſaw theſe things, and heard them, and when I had heard and ſeen, I fell down to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before the feet of the Angel, which ſhewed me theſe things. Then ſaith he unto me, <hi>ſee thou doe it not,</hi> for I am thy Fellow ſervant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings of this book: worſhip God.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>worſhipping of Images,</hi> Ex. 20.4, 5. Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeneſſe of any thing, that is in heaven above, or that is

               <p>Q. <hi>Have the Antient Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Churches, held all points of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, of ceremony, and of Diſcipline, as the Church of Rome now doth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No. The preſent Chuch of Rome notwithſtanding their great boaſt of Antiquity, doth hold ſome points of Doctrine which the Antients did not, and doth not hold ſome which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients did. Again, they practiſe at this day diverſe ceremonies which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients did not, and have left off the uſe of diverſe Antient ceremonies. And laſtly, the preſent Church of Rome hath laid aſide the exerciſe of diverſe points or matters of Diſcipline which the Antients
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40728:173"/> uſed. See all this proved by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Q. Were there any before</hi> Luther, <hi>who diſſented from the doctrine of the preſent Romiſh Church, and who would not ſubject their neckes to her yoke and government, or who thought her</hi> fallible?</p>
               <p>A. Yes. Before <hi>Luther</hi> there were diverſe eminent and famous witneſſes to the truth of that Religion and Doctrine for the main, which the Proteſtants hold diverſe from the preſent Church of Rome.

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and him that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, 16.
